Shikimori and Izumi make for an incredibly heartwarming couple!

I like how this show explores an idyllic relationship in a down-to-earth yet charming setting (there's Tonikawa, but that's kinda...um...literally not down-to-earth in a sense). I get many 癒し系 vibes from it too, like with Takagi-san.

I also love how「ハニージェットコースター」carries both upbeat and chill vibes across its two main parts, much like the show it strives to make an entrance for.

Amazing stuff; I look forward to what the manga has to offer!
