# Why?

Fiction is powerful in its ability to shape a person's beliefs, values, and actions. It supplements 
life with the ability to create ideas that surpass the limits of reality.

In my case, fiction was a gateway to a more profound understanding of society and my role in it. This played into my life in the form of anime.

Anime is a realm that grounds itself in absurdity. Perhaps it's a complement to the rigidity of Japanese society.

When I look back, one of the things I'm glad I did was to keep an open mind. In a space defined by uncertainty, you're bound to see things that discomfort you.

It's the acceptance of the unknown that ultimately lead me to where I am today. Each show has a story to tell, characters to introduce, and ideas to impart.

I think the joy of anime is in being able to look back at all the stories that have contributed to your worldview.

[A Certain Scientific Railgun](https://anilist.co/anime/6213/) taught me the true meaning of trusting myself. [Journey of Elaina](https://anilist.co/manga/98741/) showed me the value of enjoying the journey over the destination. [New Game!](https://anilist.co/manga/85697/NEW-GAME/) helped me make sense of the things I love doing and why I loved doing them. [Classroom of the Elite](https://anilist.co/anime/145545/-2nd-Season/) pulled me out of the depths of rigidity and made me question the beliefs I had held onto for years on end.

I'm told that I'm vastly different from who I was two years ago. Different in that I seem to be more laid-back, willing to let life flow as it will. I say that all of that is thanks to anime.

Seek stories, listen to the hearts of the characters, let the music dance, and have the story's spirit wash over you. Have fun, and life will feel like an amazing adventure to go through! : )
