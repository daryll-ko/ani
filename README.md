# `mental_out`
ハロー！This is my repo for all things anime, manga, and light novel-related: thoughts, seasonal picks, technical AniList-related stuff, and more.

There are two main folders in here: `analytical` and `intuitive`. They're named after one of my favorite [David Perell](https://perell.com/) essays: [Practice Analytically, Perform Intuitively](https://perell.com/essay/practice-analytically-perform-intuitively/). I think it's an incredible mental model to take into heart, even when it comes to appreciating a medium like anime.

`analytical` contains things related to my rating system, setup, and seasonal picks.

`intuitive` contains my thoughts on the shows I watch and the books I read. These are what go into my AniList notes.
